"Damn such a great phone. Camera is really good, battery lasts long enough, super smooth even though its just 60 hz XDR display. Videos with action mode on are insanely stable and crisp.The night mode can take some really good shots jn low light conditions .The whole apple environment itself is so seamless. I shifted from android to iPhone and it barely took any time since I had iPad and a mac already. With a just a few clicks the phone was ready to go.READ MORE",Flipkart Customer,"Jan, 2023", Rajgarh

"The iPhone 14 is a solid choice for those looking for a high-quality smartphone experience. The camera is top-notch, the performance is smooth, and the design is sleek and modern. However, there are a few drawbacks to consider when comparing it to Android phones.One of the biggest cons of the iPhone 14 is its lack of customization options. Apple has a strict policy on what apps and features can be used on their devices, which can be frustrating for users who want more control over their pho...READ MORE",KESHAV KUMAR MEENA,"Jan, 2023", Bengaluru
